# Portfolio-Management-System

## Motivation
- In these unprecedented times many people have lost their wealth because of wrong investment decisions made, which are encouraged by human emotions.
- A strong system built on back-tested data would drive away human emotions and help people to make the right investment decision purely based on algorithms and statistics.
- Less than 1.5% of people in India invest in the stock markets and the majority lack knowledge in terms of the right stocks to invest and how to manage their portfolios efficiently. 
- Our aim is to build a strong portfolio management system which would encourage more people to invest in the markets and make the right investment decisions.

## Idea
Design and create a portfolio management system which aims to :
- Maximize the alpha (returns) and minimize the risk.
- Implement various trading & investing strategies using technical & fundamental analysis.
- Optimize strategies using machine learning algorithms.
- Use Algorithmic Trading to remove the psychological & emotional bias faced during the investment process.
